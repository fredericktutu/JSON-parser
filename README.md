# JSON-parser
Parse JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) string to Python object

+ Just for Fun
+ note that for array & object, I add another comma(",") at the end(just like golang
+ It can handle errors, but is not completed yet.


#some example
```
  {"x": 1, "y: true, "z": {"a": 1.5, "b": null,}, "l": [1,2,3,4,],}
```
